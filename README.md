# User Management Dashboard  

## Objective  
Develop a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete user details by interacting with a mock backend API.  

## Features  
1. **View Users**: Display a list of users with details like ID, First Name, Last Name, Email, and Department.  
2. **Add Users**: Provide a form to add new users by posting data to the API.  
3. **Edit Users**: Fetch current user data, allow edits via a form, and update the API with the changes.  
4. **Delete Users**: Remove users by sending a delete request to the API.  
5. **Error Handling**: Display appropriate error messages when API requests fail.  
6. **Bonus Features (Optional)**:  
   - Pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list.  
   - Client-side validation for the input form.  
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop screens.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/React.js (or any framework of your choice)  
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios or Fetch API  
- **Backend**: [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a mock REST API  

## Endpoints
